                        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), melted</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
                        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
                        <li>1 pinch ground cardamom</li>
                        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying</li>

                    <div>
                        In a large bowl, stir together the milk powder, flour, baking powder, and cardamom. 
                        Stir in the almonds, pistachios and golden raisins. Mix in the melted ghee, then pour 
                        in the milk, and continue to mix until well blended. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.

                        In a large skillet, stir together the sugar, water, rose water and a pinch of cardamom. 
                        Bring to a boil, and simmer for just a minute. Set aside.
                        
                        Fill a large heavy skillet halfway with oil. Heat over medium heat for at least 5 minutes. 
                        Knead the dough, and form into about 20 small balls. Reduce the heat of the oil to low, and 
                        fry the balls in one or two batches. After about 5 minutes, they will start to float, and expand to twice 
                        their original size, but the color will not change much. After the jamun float, increase the heat to 
                        medium, and turn them frequently until light golden.
